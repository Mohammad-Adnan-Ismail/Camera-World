I had 40D, 5D MKIIm 5D MKIII and now R5 and so far R5 is most probably the best of them when it comes to the way it is built.But then again, it could be my case only and my perception."

        "comment": "Canon EOS R5 has a very simple and uncluttered front, with a single programmable button that is by default used for exposure preview. The top of the camera, however, has a number of dials and function buttons that make it easy to switch between different camera modes and settings."

        "comment": "At the heart of the EOS R5 is a 45-megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor that delivers previously unheard-of levels of image quality. Detail and clarity are simply stunning, as is colour reproduction, tonal gradation and dynamic range. The sensor operates with a maximum sensitivity of ISO 51,200 so you can take advantage of the EOS R5 sensational image quality even in low-light conditions."

        "comment": "The EOS R5 has a low light AF limit of EV-6, which means it can autofocus on subjects even in conditions as dark as the one shown in the image above. If I could not use the AF, I would have had to switch to manual focusing, which is more time consuming. Even better, the Face Detection and Eye Detection AF worked thanks to a significantly improved AF algorithm, making the shoot even smoother."

        "comment": " Canon EOS R5 is much more specialized thanks to its high-resolution 45-megapixel sensor that is capable of shooting 8K video. As a result, it is a fairly sophisticated camera with a complex menu system and controls. In this article, I am going to share my recommended camera settings for the Camon EOS R5, which will hopefully make it easy for our readers to get started with this camera."
