            <h3 className='p-5'>What is Context API ?</h3>
            <p className='container'>Answer: Context API is a React structure that allows you to exchange different information and help resolve conflicts from all levels of your application. This is another way of “piercing the prop” or moving props from grandfather to child to parent, and so on. Content is also considered as a simple, easy way for country managers using Redux. Returns buyer and provider. The provider is part of the fact that as its names suggest it gives status to its children. It will hold the "store" and be the parent of all the parts that may need that store. The buyer as it happens is the part that eats and uses the state.</p>
            <h3 className='p-5'>What is Semantic Tag ?</h3>
            <p className='container'>Answer: Semantic HTML tags provide information about the contents of those tags that goes beyond just how they look on a page. Text that is enclosed in the tag is immediately recognized by the browser as some type of coding language. Semantic HTML or semantic marker is HTML that renders meaning on a web page rather than just a presentation. For example, a tag indicates the entered text as a paragraph. This is both semantic and presentation because people know what categories, and browsers know how to display them. On the reverse side of this mathematical, tags are similar and non-semantic. They only define what the text should look like (bold or italic), and do not give any additional meaning to the text.
